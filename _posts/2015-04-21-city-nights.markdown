### Purposes of this company:
  Give a special touch to each palate. I want to expand the variety of flavors and always provide a unique service of every occasion.


### Collaboration!
  Sara's hope is that her collaboration with Ser Mujer continues to grow and develop her bussines.She would love to own her own bakery again, and be able to dell and ship her pastries all over the world.For now, she's honing her craft at home and taking orders over the phone. Ser Mujer has provided Sara both resources and helpful mentors.
